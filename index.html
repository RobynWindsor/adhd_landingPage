        Individuals with ADHD have difficulties with maintaining attention,
        executive function and working memory. Recently, deficits in executive
        function have emerged as key factors affecting academic and career
        success. Executive function is the brains ability to prioritize and
        manage thoughts and actions. Individuals who have issues with executive
        functioning may have difficulties completing tasks or may forget
        important things.

        The structure of SheCodes courses is ideal for anyone with ADHD wanting
        to learn front-end web development. The lessons are on average, no more
        than 10minutes long with a fun and challenging practical challenge
        afterwards. Each week you are given homework which emcompasses all the
        skills you have learned that week. Additional self-learning is required
        which is a fantastic skill to learn effectively, in preparation for the
        working environment within web development spaces.

      This is the very first thing I built when I started to learn how to code at the start of 2023. I am using basic HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. No frameworks or libraries are used here. 
      I have used vanilla Javscript to add a simple event listener and a query selector to re-render the inner HTML of the 'h1`.
